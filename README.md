***Ginnunmezzeron, the Necrospire*** is a tabletop roleplaying game setting that, currently, is system agnostic. It is meant for open table play.

This project is using semantic versioning through it development life cycle as a way to test a different concept of what TTRPG editions can look like. There will be three parts to the versioning name:

1. The major number
2. The minor number
3. The patch number

A change to the patch number (ie going from v1.0.1 to v1.0.2), indicates there have been trivial updates that aren't going to affect the players gameplay, mechanically. This usually will look like lore or worldbuilding being changed/retconned/updated/etc.
  
Minor release updates (ie going from v1.0.2 to 1.1.0) indicates that there’s been an actual change to mechanical functionality in the game. This can be a mechanical change, adding completely new functionality, or removing existing functionality. 

A major release, like going from version 1.1.0 to version 2.0.0, indicates changes that might break backward compatibility or significantly alter functionality.
